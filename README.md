code for context switching on an ATmega328P microcontroller using the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm:

Include necessary header files: Include the necessary header files for the ATmega328P microcontroller, such as avr/io.h for I/O port definitions and avr/interrupt.h for interrupt handling.

Define constants and variables: Define any constants and variables required for the code. For example, you can define MAX_TASKS to specify the maximum number of tasks to be scheduled.

Initialize hardware peripherals: Set up any required hardware peripherals such as timers, I/O ports, or ADC channels. These configurations depend on the specific requirements of your tasks.

Define task functions: Implement the task functions for each task that you want to schedule. Each task function should contain the specific functionality you want to execute for that task.

Define the Task Control Block (TCB): Create a structure to represent the Task Control Block (TCB) that holds information about each task. The TCB can include fields such as task ID, task state, stack pointer, and other relevant task information.

Initialize the TCB array: Create an array of TCB structures to hold the information for each task. Initialize the TCB array with the appropriate values for each task, such as task IDs and other relevant parameters.

Initialize the context switching mechanism: Set up the necessary components for context switching. This typically involves configuring and enabling the timer interrupt that will trigger the context switch.

Implement the context switching ISR (Interrupt Service Routine): Define an ISR for the timer interrupt that handles the context switching logic. The ISR should save the current task's context, update the current task index, and load the context of the next task.

Implement the task scheduler: Create a task scheduler function that determines the next task to be executed based on the FCFS algorithm. The scheduler selects the next task from the TCB array and initiates the context switch.

Main function: In the main function, enable global interrupts, start the task scheduler, and enter an infinite loop to keep the program running.

Task execution: Each task function should contain the desired functionality for that task. The tasks will be executed in a sequential manner based on the FCFS algorithm, with the scheduler triggering the context switch to switch between tasks.
